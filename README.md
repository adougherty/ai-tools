# ai-tools
 
AI-Tools is a collection of tools that use generative ai to create images for your characters and icons. The current features have been implemented:
* Use Dall-E 3 to create a profile picture for an NPC Actor (and update the corresponding prototype token)
* Use Dall-E 3 to create an image for a token representing anything on the canvas. **This means you can have a unique image for each of your bandits!**
* Use Dall-E 3 to create an image for Items, including feats, spells, equipment, actions, etc.

More tools are planned to help the DM run their games unencumbered with the assistance of Generative Artificial Intelligence.

## Generating Something

When the module is installed and enabled, you will find a recycle icon on the top left of an image that can be updated with AI.
