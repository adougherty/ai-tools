# ai-tools

**Important!:** This tool uses the OpenAI API to preform its AI functions. You will need a key from OpenAI to use this tool. OpenAI will change a fee to depending on how much you use the tool.

**The AI-Tools Module does not collect any personal information**, including payment information. All financial arrangements are made between the Gamemaster and OpenAI.
 
AI-Tools is a collection of tools that use generative ai to create images for your characters and icons. The current features have been implemented:
* Use Dall-E 3 to create a profile picture for an NPC Actor (and update the corresponding prototype token)
* Use Dall-E 3 to create an image for a token representing anything on the canvas. **This means you can have a unique image for each of your bandits!**
* Use Dall-E 3 to create an image for Items, including feats, spells, equipment, actions, etc.

More tools are planned to help the DM run their games unencumbered with the assistance of Generative Artificial Intelligence.

## Generating Something

When the module is installed and enabled, you will find a recycle icon on the top left of an image that can be updated with AI.

You will be notified when the process has begun, and when it has concluded. It's that easy!

## What information is sent?
When making a request to generate an image, information contained in your document, and possible associated documents, along with your OpenAI Secret API Key will be sent to the OpenAI servers.

## How to get an Open AI Key?

1. Go to [https://openai.com] and create an account.
2. Go to [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys] and create a new secret key
3. Place that key into the module settings:

## Does this cost money?
Kinda/Yes? I, as the module developer do not make any income off this module. However, OpenAI the company that actually does the hard work of creating the images does charge for their services. As of this writing (3/29/2024) OpenAI charges $0.08 USD per image created.
